# BAGS
- It is an unordered collection of values that may have duplicates. 

#### Characteristics of Bags
1. Allowing Duplicate Elements: Unlike sets, which enforce uniqueness, a bag allows duplicate elements

2. No Order: Bags do not maintain any specific order of elements and there is no inherent indexing or sorting associated with bags.

3. Flexible Size: Bags can grow or shrink dynamically as elements are added or removed. 

4. Mutable: Bags are mutable collections, which means you can modify their contents by adding or removing elements.

5. No Direct Access by Index: Unlike lists, bags do not provide direct access to elements by index. 

6. Common Operations: Bags typically support common collection operations such as adding elements, removing elements e.t.c

- When working with bags in Java, you can choose from various implementations provided by the Java Collections Framework, such as ArrayList, LinkedList, or HashSet. 

- The choice of implementation depends on your specific requirements, such as performance, memory usage, or the need for maintaining insertion order.
